### Cross-origin resource sharing

[CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) allows JavaScript web apps to make HTTP requests to other domains. This is important for third party web apps using Flextype, as without CORS, a JavaScript app hosted on example.com couldn't access our APIs because they're hosted on another.com which is a different domain.

CORS is [supported by all modern browsers](http://caniuse.com/cors). Read more about using CORS in this [tutorial](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/).

### JSON format details

Flextype represents resources as [JSON](http://json.org/), encoded in UTF-8. Flextype represents dates and times as [Unix Timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com).
