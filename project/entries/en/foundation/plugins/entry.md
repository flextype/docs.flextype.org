Plugins are the foundation for adding new features to the Flextype by extending it.

Each Flextype plugin is an additional piece of software that can be easily installed to extend the functionality of Flextype core.

This allows you to customize your Flextype powered project with your desired functionality. Since so much functionality is provided through plugins, Flextype core is full-featured and customizable, without having to include everything for everyone.

Plugins are available via the Flextype Plugin Directory.
