## What’s Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

For instance, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., `**this text is bold**`). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.

The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.

Note: Using Markdown doesn't mean that you can't also use HTML. You can add HTML tags to any Markdown file. This is helpful if you prefer certain HTML tags to Markdown syntax. For example, some people find that it's easier to use HTML tags for images.

## Headings

Headings from `h1` through `h6` are constructed with a `#` for each level:

    # h1 Heading
    ## h2 Heading
    ### h3 Heading
    #### h4 Heading
    ##### h5 Heading
    ###### h6 Heading
    

Renders to:

# h1 Heading

## h2 Heading

### h3 Heading

#### h4 Heading

##### h5 Heading

###### h6 Heading

HTML:

    <h1>h1 Heading</h1>
    <h2>h2 Heading</h2>
    <h3>h3 Heading</h3>
    <h4>h4 Heading</h4>
    <h5>h5 Heading</h5>
    <h6>h6 Heading</h6>
    

## Comments

Comments should be HTML compatible

    <!--
    This is a comment
    -->
    

Comment below should **NOT** be seen:

<!--

## Horizontal Rules

The HTML `<hr>` element is for creating a "thematic break" between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a `<hr>` with any of the following:

* `___`: three consecutive underscores
* `---`: three consecutive dashes
* `***`: three consecutive asterisks

renders to:

* * *

* * *
